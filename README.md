Source Code is inside app/src/

Android APK file is inside app/bin/

Documentation is inside app/doc/

I have created LargeUML file inside doc folder that has the entire layout of classes performed using Android Studio plugins that I got to know at the last moment, so I couldnt add much to it.

Look at smallUML before LargeUML
